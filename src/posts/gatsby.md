I'm trying to build a blog site using Gatsby, graphql, and eventually Contentful as the CMS. So far it has been excruciating. But I can see where this is headed. As long as I follow this tutorial to the T then I think there's hope I might actually be able to do it.

### Attempts made

1. NextJS app
2. Plain react app
3. Gatsby blog site boilerplate
4. Video-led Gatsby site from scratch
